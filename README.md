# hello-sense-server
Open source self hosted server for Hello's Sense Sleep Tracker
---

This software is intended to function as a backend server for the Sense sleep tracker, seeing as Hello has indicated that it will shut down its servers.

Any contributions are very welcome, specifically any details of the API and exchange of messages between the Sense and the servers of Hello.
